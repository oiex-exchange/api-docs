Welcome to Oiex API! You can use this API to get market data, trade, and manage your account.
Oiex provides flexible APIs to help users integrate Oiex transaction quickly and efficiently into their applications.
Oiex supports both Rest API and WebSocket API.
It is recommended that developer use the Rest API when performing functions such as trading or withdrawal, and use the WebSocket API to obtain information such as market prices and trading depth.
<br/>

### Access Description

###WEBSOCKET API
``
wss://ws.oiex.com/websocket
``

### Data compression
All data of the WebSocket API is compressed by GZIP, then Base64.encode () is encoded and returned in binary mode, and the user needs to decode and decompress after receiving the binary data.
<br/>

### Prompt message

When the user's client Websocket connected to the Oiex Websocket server, the server will periodically send a ping message to user (currently set as 5 seconds) and include a timestamp.
After receiving this prompt message, the user should promptly return the pong message and include the same timestamp in the following format:

```js
{"ping": 1562979600}

{"pong": 1562979600}
```
If the Websocket server continuously sent ping messages for three times without receiving any “pong” messages, the server will automatically disconnect with the client.
However, after connecting to the server, the user can also send a message “ping” to the server. When the server received the information of ping , it will reply a “pong” message.



### Disconnect

The user may disconnect by themselves or send a “close” message to the Oiex Websocket server .



### Subscribe the topics


After connected with Websocket server, the Websocket client should send the following request to subscribe the specific topic:
```js
{"channel":"ex_single_market","market":{Market},"event":"addChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_group_market","group":{Group},"event":"addChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_last_trade","market":{Market},"since":{Since},"event":"addChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_depth_data","market":{Market},"event":"addChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_chart_update","market":{Market},"since":{Since},"interval":{Interval},"event":"addChannel"}
```
After subscribed the topic, the Websocket client will receive all the data flow from the corresponding topic.
Next, once the subscribed topic is updated, the Websocket client will receive an update message “push” by the server:

<br/>

### Unsubscribe
The format of unsubscribing is as follows

```js
{"channel":"ex_single_market","market":{Market},"event":"removeChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_group_market","group":{Group},"event":"removeChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_depth_data","market":{Market},"event":"removeChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_last_trade","market":{Market},"event":"removeChannel"}

{"channel":"ex_chart_update","market":{Market},"interval":{Interval},"event":"removeChannel"}
```
